Table for GNU Octave
====================

Tabular data structure for Octave.

| WARNING: All the code in here is currently experimental. (Pre-beta quality, that is.) Do not use it in any production or business code! Seriously!! |
| ---- |

This package attempts to provide a set of mostly-Matlab-compatible implementation of the table class. It provides:

  * `table` and related construction/conversion functions
  * `ismissing` and friends
    * `ismissing` and `rmmissing` are currently implemented; `standardizeMissing`, `fillmissing`, and `@missing` are not.
  * `eqn` and `isnanny`
    * These are experimental Octave extensions for dealing with NaN-like values. They are used by `table`, `ismissing`, and friends, but should be generally useful, and need to be global so they can be overridden by user-defined classes.

## Installation and usage

### Quick start

To get started using or testing this project, install it using Octave's `pkg` function:

```
pkg install https://github.com/apjanke/octave-table/archive/master.zip
pkg load table
```

### Installation for development

* Clone the repo
  * `git clone https://github.com/apjanke/octave-table`
* Add the `inst/` directory from the repo to your Octave path.

## Documentation

See the `doc-project/` directory for notes on this project, especially for [Developer Notes](doc-project/Developer-Notes.md). Also see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to contribute to this project.

Real user documentation is hopefully coming soon.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

### No Matlab usage!

To avoid issues with the Matlab license's Non-Compete clause, this project needs to be developed entirely using Octave, and not using Matlab at all, including for testing or benchmarking purposes. Please do not submit any Matlab test or benchmark results, or any code produced using Matlab.
