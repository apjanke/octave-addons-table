Table
======

Tabular data structure for Octave.

This package attempts to provide a set of mostly-Matlab-compatible implementation of the table class.

All the code in here is currently experimental. Do not use it in any production code!

## Installation and usage

### Quick start

To get started using or testing this project, install it using Octave's `pkg` function:

```
pkg install https://github.com/apjanke/octave-addons-table/archive/master.zip
pkg load table
```

### Installation for development

* Clone the repo
  * `git clone https://github.com/apjanke/octave-addons-table`
* Add the `inst/` directory from the repo to your Octave path.

## Naming conventions

Anything in a namespace with `internal` in its name is for the internal use of this package, and is not intended for use by user code.

## Documentation

See the `doc-project/` directory for notes on this project, especially for [Developer Notes](doc-project/Developer-Notes.md). Also see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to contribute to this project.

Real user documentation is hopefully coming soon.
