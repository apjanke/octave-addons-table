Henderson and Velleman (1981) comment in a footnote to Table 1: “Hocking
[original transcriber]’s noncrucial coding of the Mazda’s rotary engine
as a straight six-cylinder engine and the Porsche’s flat engine as a V
engine, as well as the inclusion of the diesel Mercedes 240D, have been
retained to enable direct comparisons to be made with previous analyses.”
