Tablicious datasets
===================

This datasets/ directory contains code for acquiring and reconstructing the example datasets used in this package.

Everything in here is done manually, for now.
Typically, you'll cd into the directory for a dataset, run reconstruct_dataset, and then copy the resulting .mat file into inst/ under the root of the repo.
