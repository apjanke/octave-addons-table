1 Introduction
**************

This is the manual for the Tablicious package version 0.1.0 for GNU
Octave.

   Tablicious provides Matlab-compatible tabular data support for GNU
Octave.  This includes a ‘table’ class with support for filtering and
join operations, Missing Data support, and ‘string’ and ‘categorical’
data types.

   This document is a work in progress.  You are invited to help improve
it and submit patches.

   Tablicious was written by Andrew Janke <<floss@apjanke.net>>.
Support can be found on the Tablicious project GitHub page
(https://github.com/apjanke/octave-tablicious).

2 Getting Started
*****************

The easiest way to obtain Tablicious is by using Octave’s ‘pkg’ package
manager.  To install the development prerelease of Tablicious, run this
in Octave:

     pkg install https://github.com/apjanke/octave-tablicious/releases/download/v0.1.0/tablicious-0.1.0.tar.gz

   (Check the releases page at
<https://github.com/apjanke/octave-tablicious/releases> to find out what
the actual latest release number is.)

   For development, you can obtain the source code for Tablicious from
the project repo on GitHub at
<https://github.com/apjanke/octave-tablicious>.  Make a local clone of
the repo.  Then add the ‘inst’ directory in the repo to your Octave
path.

3 Table Representation
**********************

Tablicious provides the ‘table’ class for representing tabular data.

File: Tablicious.info,  Node: table Class,  Up: Table Representation

3.1 ‘table’ Class
=================

A ‘table’ is an array object that represents a tabular data structure.
It holds multiple named “variables”, each of which is a column vector,
or a 2-D matrix whose rows are read as records.


File: Tablicious.info,  Node: Missing Functionality,  Next: API Reference,  Prev: Table Representation,  Up: Top

4 Missing Functionality
***********************

Tablicious is based on Matlab’s table API and supports most of its major
functionality.  But not all of it is implemented yet.  The missing parts
are currently:

   • ‘timetable’
   • Moving window methods in ‘fillmissing’
   • ‘summary()’ for ‘table’ and ‘categorical’
   • Assignment to table variables using ‘.’-indexing
   • File I/O like ‘readtable()’ and ‘writetable()’

   It is the author’s hope that all these will be implemented some day.

-----------------

 -- Function: OUT = array2table (C)
 -- Function: OUT = array2table (..., ‘'VariableNames'’, VARIABLENAMES)
 -- Function: OUT = array2table (..., ‘'RowNames'’, ROWNAMES)

     Convert an array to a table.

     Converts a 2-D array to a table, with columns in the array becoming
     variables in the output table.  This is typically used on numeric
     arrays, but it can be applied to any type of array.

     You may not want to use this on cell arrays, though, because you
     will end up with a table that has all its variables of type cell.
     If you use ‘cell2table’ instead, columns of the cell array which
     can be condensed into primitive arrays will be.  With
     ‘array2table’, they won’t be.

5.2.2 categorical
-----------------

 -- Class: categorical

     Categorical variable array.

     A ‘categorical’ array represents an array of values of a
     categorical variable.  Each ‘categorical’ array stores the element
     values along with a list of the categories, and indicators of
     whether the categories are ordinal (that is, they have a meaningful
     mathematical ordering), and whether the set of categories is
     protected (preventing new categories from being added to the
     array).

     In addition to the categories defined in the array, a categorical
     array may have elements of "undefined" value.  This is not
     considered a category; rather, it is the absence of any known
     value.  It is analagous to a ‘NaN’ value.

     This class is not fully implemented yet.  Missing stuff: - gt, ge,
     lt, le - Ordinal support in general - countcats - summary

 -- Instance Variable of categorical: ‘uint16’ code

     The numeric codes of the array element values.  These are indexes
     into the ‘cats’ category list.

     This is a planar property.

 -- Instance Variable of categorical: ‘logical’ tfMissing

     A logical mask indicating whether each element of the array is
     missing (that is, undefined).

     This is a planar property.

 -- Instance Variable of categorical: ‘cellstr’ cats

     The names of the categories in this array.  This is the list into
     which the ‘code’ values are indexes.

 -- Instance Variable of categorical: ‘scalar_logical’ isOrdinal

     A scalar logical indicating whether the categories in this array
     have an ordinal relationship.

5.2.2.1 categorical.categorical
...............................

 -- Constructor: OBJ = categorical ()

     Constructs a new scalar categorical whose value is undefined.

 -- Constructor: OBJ = categorical (VALS)
 -- Constructor: OBJ = categorical (VALS, VALUESET)
 -- Constructor: OBJ = categorical (VALS, VALUESET, CATEGORY_NAMES)
 -- Constructor: OBJ = categorical (..., ‘'Ordinal'’, ORDINAL)
 -- Constructor: OBJ = categorical (..., ‘'Protected'’, PROTECTED)

     Constructs a new categorical array from the given values.

     VALS is the array of values to convert to categoricals.

     VALUESET is the set of all values from which VALS is drawn.  If
     omitted, it defaults to the unique values in VALS.

     CATEGORY_NAMES is a list of category names corresponding to
     VALUESET.  If omitted, it defaults to VALUESET, converted to
     strings.

     ORDINAL is a logical indicating whether the category values in OBJ
     have a numeric ordering relationship.  Defaults to false.

     PROTECTED indicates whether OBJ should be protected, which prevents
     the addition of new categories to the array.  Defaults to false.

----------------

 -- Function: OUT = cell2table (C)
 -- Function: OUT = cell2table (..., ‘'VariableNames'’, VARIABLENAMES)
 -- Function: OUT = cell2table (..., ‘'RowNames'’, ROWNAMES)

     Convert a cell array to a table.

     Converts a 2-dimensional cell matrix into a table.  Each column in
     the input C becomes a variable in OUT.  For columns that contain
     all scalar values of ‘cat’-compatible types, they are “popped out”
     of their cells and condensed into a homogeneous array of the
     contained type.

---------------

 -- Function: OUT = colvecfun (FCN, X)

     Apply a function to column vectors in array.

     Applies the given function FCN to each column vector in the array
     X, by iterating over the indexes along all dimensions except
     dimension 1.  Collects the function return values in an output
     array.

     FCN must be a function which takes a column vector and returns a
     column vector of the same size.  It does not have to return the
     same type as X.

     Returns the result of applying fcn to each column in x, all
     concatenated together in the same shape as x.

5.2.5 contains
--------------

 -- Function: OUT = colvecfun (STR, PATTERN)
 -- Function: OUT = colvecfun (..., ‘'IgnoreCase'’, IGNORECASE)

     Test if strings contain a pattern.

     Tests whether the given strings contain the given pattern(s).

     STR (char, cellstr, or string) is a list of strings to compare
     against pattern.

     PATTERN (char, cellstr, or string) is a list of patterns to match.
     These are literal plain string patterns, not regex patterns.  If
     more than one pattern is supplied, the return value is true if the
     string matched any of them.

     Returns a logical array of the same size as the string array
     represented by STR.

 -- Function: [Y, E] = discretize (X, DUR)
 -- Function: [Y, E] = discretize (..., ‘'categorical'’)
 -- Function: [Y, E] = discretize (..., ‘'IncludedEdge'’, INCLUDEDEDGE)

     Group data into discrete bins or categories.

     N is the number of bins to group the values into.

     EDGES is an array of edge values defining the bins.

     DUR is a ‘duration’ value indicating the length of time of each
     bin.

     If ‘'categorical'’ is specified, the resulting values are a
     ‘categorical’ array instead of a numeric array of bin indexes.

     Returns: Y - the bin index or category of each value from X E - the
     list of bin edge values

5.2.7 dispstrs
--------------

 -- Function: OUT = dispstrs (X)

     Display strings for array.

     Gets the display strings for each element of X.  The display
     strings should be short, one-line, human-presentable strings
     describing the value of that element.

     The default implementation of ‘dispstrs’ can accept input of any
     type, and has decent implementations for Octave’s standard built-in
     types, but will have opaque displays for most user-defined objects.

     This is a polymorphic method that user-defined classes may override
     with their own custom display that is more informative.

     Returns a cell array the same size as X.

5.2.8 endsWith
--------------

 -- Function: OUT = endsWith (STR, PATTERN)
 -- Function: OUT = endsWith (..., ‘'IgnoreCase'’, IGNORECASE)

     Test if strings end with a pattern.

     Tests whether the given strings end with the given pattern(s).

     STR (char, cellstr, or string) is a list of strings to compare
     against PATTERN.

     PATTERN (char, cellstr, or string) is a list of patterns to match.
     These are literal plain string patterns, not regex patterns.  If
     more than one pattern is supplied, the return value is true if the
     string matched any of them.

     Returns a logical array of the same size as the string array
     represented by STR.


File: Tablicious.info,  Node: eqn,  Next: fillmissing,  Prev: endsWith,  Up: API Alphabetically

5.2.9 eqn
---------

 -- Function: OUT = eqn (A, B)

     Determine element-wise equality, treating NaNs as equal

     out = eqn (A, B)

     ‘eqn’ is just like ‘eq’ (the function that implements the ‘==’
     operator), except that it considers NaN and NaN-like values to be
     equal.  This is the element-wise equivalent of ‘isequaln’.

     ‘eqn’ uses ‘isnannish’ to test for NaN and NaN-like values, which
     means that NaNs and NaTs are considered to be NaN-like, and string
     arrays’ “missing” and categorical objects’ “undefined” values are
     considered equal, because they are NaN-ish.

     Developer’s note: the name “‘eqn’” is a little unfortunate, because
     “eqn” could also be an abbreviation for “equation”.  But this name
     follows the ‘isequaln’ pattern of appending an “n” to the
     corresponding non-NaN-equivocating function.

 -- Function: [OUT, TFFILLED] = fillmissing (X, ‘'constant'’, FILL_VAL)
 -- Function: [OUT, TFFILLED] = fillmissing (X, MOVMETHOD, WINDOW)

     Fill missing values.

     Fills missing values in X according to the method specified by
     METHOD.

     This method is only partially implemented.

     METHOD may be: ‘'constant'’ ‘'previous'’ ‘'next'’ ‘'nearest'’
     ‘'linear'’ ‘'spline'’ ‘'pchip'’ MOVMETHOD may be: ‘'movmean'’
     ‘'movmedian'’

     Returns OUT, which is X but with missing values filled in, and
     TFFILLED, a logical array the same size as X which indicates which
     elements were filled.

5.2.11 isfile
-------------

 -- Function: OUT = isfile (FILE)

     FILE is a charvec containing the path to the file to test.  It may

     This is a new, more specific replacement for ‘exist(file, "file")’.

5.2.13 ismissing
----------------

 -- Function: OUT = ismissing (X)
 -- Function: OUT = ismissing (X, INDICATOR)

     Find missing values.

     Determines which elements of X contain missing values.  If an
     indicator input is not provided, standard missing values depending
     on the input type of X are used.

     Standard missing values depend on the data type: * NaN for double,
     single, duration, and calendarDuration * NaT for datetime * ‘' '’
     for char * ‘{''}’ for cellstrs * Integer numeric types have no
     standard missing value; they are never considered missing.  *
     Structs are never considered missing.  * Logicals are never
     considered missing.  * Other types have no standard missing value;
     it is currently an error to call ‘ismissing’ on them without
     providing an indicator.  * This includes cells which are not
     cellstrs; calling ‘ismissing’ on them results in an error.  * TODO:
     Determine whether this should really be an error, or if it should
     default to never considering those types as missing.  * TODO:
     Decide whether, for classdef objects, ‘ismissing’ should
     polymorphically detect isnan()/isnat()/isnannish() methods and use
     those, or whether we should require classes to override ismissing()
     itself.

     If INDICATOR is supplied, it is an array containing multiple
     values, all of which are considered to be missing values.  Only
     indicator values that are type-compatible with the input are
     considered; other indicator value types are silently ignored.  This
     is by design, so you can pass an indicator that holds sentinel
     values for disparate types in to ismissing() used for any type, or
     for compound types like table.

     Indicators are currently not supported for struct or logical
     inputs.  This is probably a bug.

     Table defines its own ismissing() method which respects individual
     variables’ data types; see *note table.ismissing::.

5.2.14 isnannish
----------------

 -- Function: OUT = isnannish (X)

     Test if elements are NaN or NaN-like

     Tests if input elements are NaN, NaT, or otherwise NaN-like.  This
     is true if isnan() or isnat() returns true, and is false for types
     that do not support isnan() or isnat().

     This function only exists because:

     a) Matlab decided to call their NaN values for datetime "NaT"
     instead, and test for them with a different "isnat()" function, and
     b) isnan() errors out for some types that do not support isnan(),
     like cells.

     isnannish() smooths over those differences so you can call it
     polymorphically on any input type.

     Under normal operation, isnannish() should not throw an error for
     any type or value of input.

5.2.15 missing
--------------

 -- Class: missing

     Generic auto-converting missing value.

     ‘missing’ is a generic missing value that auto-converts to other
     types.

     A ‘missing’ array indicates a missing value, of no particular type.
     It auto- converts to other types when it is combined with them via
     concatenation or other array combination operations.

     This class is currently EXPERIMENTAL. Use at your own risk.

     Note: This class does not actually work for assignment.  If you do
     this:

            x = 1:5
            x(3) = missing

     It’s supposed to work, but I can’t figure out how to do this in a
     normal classdef object, because there doesn’t seem to be any
     function that’s implicitly called for type conversion in that
     assignment.  Darn it.

     Remove missing values.

     If X is a vector, removes elements with missing values.  If X is a
     matrix, removes rows or columns with missing data elements.

     DIM is the dimension to operate along.  Specifying a dimension
     forces ‘rmmissing’ to operate in matrix instead of vector mode.

     MINNUMMISSING indicates how many missing element values there must
     be in a row or column for it to be considered missing and this
     removed.  This option is only used in matrix mode; it is silently
     ignored in vector mode.

     Returns: OUT - the input, with missing elements or rows or columns
     removed TF - a logical index vector indicating which elements,

     STR (char, cellstr, or string) is a list of strings to compare
     against PATTERN.

     PATTERN (char, cellstr, or string) is a list of patterns to match.
     These are literal plain string patterns, not regex patterns.  If

5.2.20 string
-------------

 -- Class: string

     A string array of Unicode strings.

     A string array is an array of strings, where each array element is
     a single string.

     The string class represents strings, where: - Each element of a
     string array is a single string - A single string is a
     1-dimensional row vector of Unicode characters - Those characters
     are encoded in UTF-8

     This should correspond pretty well to what people think of as
     strings, and is pretty compatible with people’s typical notion of
     strings in Octave.

     String arrays also have a special “missing” value, that is like the
     string equivalent of NaN for doubles or “undefined” for
     categoricals, or SQL NULL.

     This is a slightly higher-level and more strongly-typed way of
     representing strings than cellstrs are.  (A cellstr array is of
     type cell, not a text- specific type, and allows assignment of
     non-string data into it.)

     Be aware that while string arrays interconvert with Octave chars
     and cellstrs, Octave char elements represent 8-bit UTF-8 code
     units, not Unicode code points.

     This class really serves three roles.  - It is an object wrapper
     around Octave’s base primitive character types.  - It adds
     ismissing() semantics.  - And it introduces Unicode support.  Not
     clear whether it’s a good fit to have the Unicode support wrapped
     up in this.  Maybe it should just be a simple object wrapper
     wrapper, and defer Unicode semantics to when core Octave adopts
     them for char and cellstr.  On the other hand, because Octave chars
     are UTF-8, not UCS-2, some methods like strlength() and reverse()
     are just going to be wrong if they delegate straight to chars.

     “Missing” string values work like NaNs.  They are never considered
     equal, less than, or greater to any other string, including other
     missing strings.  This applies to set membership and other
     equivalence tests.

     The current implementation depends on Java for its Unicode and
     encoding support.  This means your Octave session must be running
     Java to call those methods.  This should be changed in the future
     to use a native C/C++ library and avoid the Java dependency,
     especially before this class is merged into core Octave.

     TODO: Need to decide how far to go with Unicode semantics, and how
     much to just make this an object wrapper over cellstr and defer to
     Octave’s existing char/string-handling functions.

     TODO: demote_strings should probably be static or global, so that
     other functions can use it to hack themselves into being
     string-aware.

     String comparison.

     This does the same comparison as ‘A == B’, but is not polymorphic.
     Generally, there is no reason to use ‘strcmp’ instead of ‘==’ or

5.2.20.22 string.cmp
....................

 -- Method: [OUT, OUTA, OUTB] = cmp (A, B)

     Value ordering comparison, returning -1/0/+1.

     Compares each element of A and B, returning for each element ‘i’
     whether ‘A(i)’ was less than (-1), equal to (0), or greater than
     (1) the corresponding ‘B(i)’.

     TODO: What to do about missing values?  Should missings sort to the
     end (preserving total ordering over the full domain), or should
     their comparisons result in a fourth "null"/"undef" return value,
     probably represented by NaN? FIXME: The current implementation does
     not handle missings.

     Returns a numeric array OUT of the same size as the scalar
     expansion of A and B.  Each value in it will be -1, 0, or 1.

     Also returns scalar-expanded copies of A and B as OUTA and OUTB, as
     a programming convenience.

5.2.22 table
------------

 -- Class: table

     Tabular data array containing multiple columnar variables.

     A ‘table’ is a tabular data structure that collects multiple
     parallel named variables.  Each variable is treated like a column.
     (Possibly a multi-columned column, if that makes sense.)  The types
     of variables may be heterogeneous.

     A table object is like an SQL table or resultset, or a relation, or
     a DataFrame in R or Pandas.

     A table is an array in itself: its size is NROWS-by-NVARIABLES, and
     you can index along the rows and variables by indexing into the
     table along dimensions 1 and 2.

 -- Instance Variable of table: ‘cellstr’ VariableNames

     The names of the variables in the table, as a cellstr row vector.

 -- Instance Variable of table: ‘cell’ VariableValues

     A cell vector containing the values for each of the variables.
     ‘VariableValues(i)’ corresponds to ‘VariableNames(i)’.

 -- Instance Variable of table: ‘cellstr’ RowNames

     An optional list of row names that identify each row in the table.
     This is a cellstr column vector, if present.

 -- Constructor: OBJ = table (VAR1, VAR2, ..., VARN)

     Constructs a new table from the given variables.  The variables
     passed as inputs to this constructor become the variables of the
     table.  Their names are automatically detected from the input
     variable names that you used.

 -- Constructor: OBJ = table (‘'Size'’, SZ, ‘'VariableTypes'’, VARTYPES)

     Constructs a new table of the given size, and with the given
     variable types.  The variables will contain the default value for
     elements of that type.

 -- Constructor: OBJ = table (..., ‘'VariableNames'’, VARNAMES)
 -- Constructor: OBJ = table (..., ‘'RowNames'’, ROWNAMES)

     RELLOCATION is ‘'Before'’ or ‘'After'’.

     LOCATION indicates a single variable to use as the target location,
     specified by name or index.  If it is specified by index, it is the
     index into the list of *unmoved* variables from OBJ, not the
     original full list of variables in OBJ.

     Converts the variables in OBJ specified by VARS to the specified
     data type.

     VARS is a cellstr or numeric vector specifying which variables to
     convert.

     DATATYPE specifies the data type to convert those variables to.  It
     is either a char holding the name of the data type, or a function
     handle which will perform the conversion.  If it is the name of the
     data type, there must either be a one-arg constructor of that type
     which accepts the specified variables’ current types as input, or a
     conversion method of that name defined on the specified variables’
     current type.

 -- Method: [C, IB] = join (A, B)
 -- Method: [C, IB] = join (A, B, ...)

     Combine two tables by rows using key variables, in a restricted
     form.

     This is not a "real" relational join operation.  It has the
     restrictions that: 1) The key values in B must be unique.  2) Every
     key value in A must map to a key value in B. These are restrictions
     inherited from the Matlab definition of table.join.

     You probably don’t want to use this method.  You probably want to
     use innerjoin or outerjoin instead.

 -- Method: [...] = outerjoin (A, B, ...)

     Combine two tables by rows using key variables, retaining unmatched
     rows.

     Computes the relational outer join of tables A and B. This is like
     a regular join, but also includes rows in each input which did not
     have matching rows in the other input; the columns from the missing
     side are filled in with placeholder values.

     TODO: Document options.

     Returns: OUT - A table that is the result of the outer join of A
     and B IXA - indexes into A for each row in out IXB - indexes into B

     Natural semijoin.

     Computes the natural semijoin of tables A and B. The semi-join of
     tables A and B is the set of all rows in A which have matching rows
     in B, based on comparing the values of variables with the same
     names.

     This method also computes the semijoin of B and A, for convenience.

     Returns: OUTA - all the rows in A with matching row(s) in B IXA -
     the row indexes into A which produced OUTA OUTB - all the rows in B
     with matching row(s) in A IXB - the row indexes into B which
     produced OUTB

........................

 -- Method: [OUTA, IXA, OUTB, IXB] = antijoin (A, B)

     Natural antijoin (AKA “semidifference”).

     Computes the anti-join of A and B. The anti-join is defined as all
     the rows from one input which do not have matching rows in the
     other input.

     Returns: OUTA - all the rows in A with no matching row in B IXA -
     the row indexes into A which produced OUTA OUTB - all the rows in B
     with no matching row in A IXB - the row indexes into B which
     produced OUTB

5.2.22.46 table.cartesian
.........................

 -- Method: [OUT, IXS] = cartesian (A, B)

     Cartesian product of two tables.

     Computes the Cartesian product of two tables.  The Cartesian
     product is each row in A combined with each row in B.

     Due to the definition and structural constraints of table, the two
     inputs must have no variable names in common.  It is an error if
     they do.

     The Cartesian product is seldom used in practice.  If you find
     yourself calling this method, you should step back and re-evaluate
     what you are doing, asking yourself if that is really what you want
     to happen.  If nothing else, writing a function that calls
     cartesian() is usually much less efficient than alternate ways of
     arriving at the same result.

     This implementation does not remove duplicate values.  TODO:
     Determine whether this duplicate-removing behavior is correct.

     The ordering of the rows in the output is not specified, and may be
     implementation- dependent.  TODO: Determine if we can lock this
     behavior down to a fixed, defined ordering, without killing
     performance.

5.2.22.47 table.groupby
.......................

 -- Method: [OUT] = groupby (OBJ, GROUPVARS, AGGCALCS)

     Find groups in table data and apply functions to variables within
     groups.

     This works like an SQL ‘"SELECT ... GROUP BY ..."’ statement.

     GROUPVARS (cellstr, numeric) is a list of the grouping variables,
     identified by name or index.

     AGGCALCS is a specification of the aggregate calculations to
     perform on them, in the form ‘{’OUT_VAR‘,’ FCN‘,’ IN_VARS‘; ...}’,
     where: OUT_VAR (char) is the name of the output variable FCN
     (function handle) is the function to apply to produce it IN_VARS
     (cellstr) is a list of the input variables to pass to fcn

     Returns a table.

.........................

 -- Method: OUT = ismissing (OBJ)
 -- Method: OUT = ismissing (OBJ, INDICATOR)

     Find missing values.

     Finds missing values in OBJ’s variables.

     If indicator is not supplied, uses the standard missing values for
     each variable’s data type.  If indicator is supplied, the same
     indicator list is applied across all variables.

     All variables in this must be vectors.  (This is due to the
     requirement that ‘size(out) == size(obj)’.)

     Returns a logical array the same size as OBJ.

     Insert standard missing values.

     Standardizes missing values in variable data.

     If the DATAVARIABLES option is supplied, only the indicated
     variables are standardized.

     INDICATOR is passed along to ‘standardizeMissing’ when it is called
     on each of the data variables in turn.  The same indicator is used
     for all variables.  You can mix and match indicator types by just
     passing in mixed indicator types in a cell array; indicators that
     don’t match the type of the column they are operating on are just
     ignored.

     Returns a table with same variable names and types as OBJ, but with
     variable values standardized.

     group is a set of rows that have the same values in all their
     variable elements.

     Returns: G - A double column vector of group numbers created from
     OBJ.  TID - A table containing the row values corresponding to the
     group numbers.

5.2.22.60 table.evalWithVars
............................

 -- Method: OUT = evalWithVars (OBJ, EXPR)

     Evaluate an expression against table’s variables.

     Evaluates the M-code expression EXPR in a workspace where all of
     OBJ’s variables have been assigned to workspace variables.

     EXPR is a charvec containing an Octave expression.

     As an implementation detail, the workspace will also contain some
     variables that are prefixed and suffixed with "__".  So try to
     avoid those in your table variable names.

     Returns the result of the evaluation.

     Examples:

          [s,p,sp] = table_examples.SpDb
          tmp = join (sp, p);
          shipment_weight = evalWithVars (tmp, "Qty .* Weight")

5.2.22.61 table.restrict
........................

 -- Method: OUT = restrict (OBJ, EXPR)
 -- Method: OUT = restrict (OBJ, IX)

     Subset rows using variable expression or index.

     Subsets a table row-wise, using either an index vector or an
     expression involving OBJ’s variables.

     If the argument is a numeric or logical vector, it is interpreted
     as an index into the rows of this.  (Just as with ‘subsetRows
     (this, index)‘.)

     If the argument is a char, then it is evaulated as an M-code
     expression, with all of this’ variables available as workspace
     variables, as with ‘evalWithVars’.  The output of expr must be a
     numeric or logical index vector (This form is a shorthand for ‘out
     = subsetRows (this, evalWithVars (this, expr))’.)

     TODO: Decide whether to name this to "where" to be more like SQL
     instead of relational algebra.

     Examples:
          [s,p,sp] = table_examples.SpDb;
          prettyprint (restrict (p, 'Weight >= 14 & strcmp(Color, "Red")'))

5.2.23 tableOuterFillValue
--------------------------

 -- Function: OUT = tableOuterFillValue (X)

     Outer fill value for variable within a table.

     Determines the fill value to usse for a given variable value X when
     that value is used as a variable in a table that is involved in an
     outer join.

     The default implementation for ‘tableOuterFillValue’ has support
     for all Octave primitive types, plus cellstrs, datetime & friends,
     strings, and ‘table’-valued variables.

     This function may become private to table before version 1.0.  It
     is currently global to make debugging more convenient.  It (or an
     equivalent) will remain global if we want to allow user-defined
     classes to customize their fill value.  It also has default logic
     that will determine the fill value for an arbitrary type by
     detecting the value used to fill elements during array expansion
     operations.  This will be appropriate for most data types.

     Returns a 1-by-ncols value of the same type as x, which may be any
     type, where ncols is the number of columns in the input.

5.2.24 vecfun
-------------

 -- Function: OUT = vecfun (FCN, X, DIM)

     Apply function to vectors in array along arbitrary dimension.

     This function is not implemented yet.

     Applies a given function to the vector slices of an N-dimensional
     array, where those slices are along a given dimension.

     FCN is a function handle to apply.

     X is an array of arbitrary type which is to be sliced and passed in
     to FCN.

     DIM is the dimension along which the vector slices lay.

     Returns the collected output of the FCN calls, which will be the
     same size as X, but not necessarily the same type.
